# Nova Banking AI 🏦 🤖

> **Status**: 🚧 Under Development (Alpha)

**Nova** is a next-generation, voice-first banking assistant designed to revolutionize customer service. Unlike traditional chatbots that only escalate issues, Nova is an **autonomous agent** capable of solving complex banking problems, analyzing financial data, and executing transactions in real-time.

## 🌟 Vision

Our goal is to build a **Complete Customer Service Agent** that:
1.  **Understands** natural language (voice & text) with human-level nuance.
2.  **Solves** issues autonomously (e.g., "Why was I charged this?", "Fix my transaction").
3.  **Escalates** intelligently only when human intervention is strictly necessary.
4.  **Proactively** monitors financial health (Fraud detection, Cashflow alerts).
